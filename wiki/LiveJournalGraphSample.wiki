#summary The social graph of [http://www.livejournal.com LiveJournal] is a nice, freely accessible, multi-million node directed graph.  Decomposing that adjacency matrix (after some suitable normalization of the rows) via SVD yields a useful metric on the graph, which encodes information beyond one degree of separation.

= Introduction =

A 132k-row sample of the adjacency matrix, as a gzip'ed tar file is available [http://www.decomposer.org/sample/ljGraph/lj_graph_sample_132k.tgz here].  It is in a format suitable for being loaded by a DiskBackedDoubleMatrix.

If you download this and unpack it, you can use this as the source for the HebbianSolver.  

To translate the row or column index into an lj user, use [http://www.decomposer.org/sample/ljGraph/profiles.txt.gz this].
